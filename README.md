Calculation of magnetic effective moment through the information of the Curie constant.

The Curie constant is a material-dependent constant that relates the magnetic susceptibility of a material to its absolute temperature and magnetic moment. It is expressed as:

C = (Nμ0μB)²/(3k)

where C is the Curie constant, N is the number of magnetic moments per unit volume, μ0 is the vacuum permeability, μB is the Bohr magneton, and k is the Boltzmann constant.

The effective magnetic moment, μeff, can be calculated using the following equation:

μeff = (NμB)²C(T-Tc)

or derivating from Curie-Weiss law, that incorporate the concept of Weeiss's molecular field

χ=CT−θ(CW)

The inverse equation is:

χ^(−1)=(T−θ(CW))/(T−θ(CW)+C)

where T is the absolute temperature, Tc is the Curie temperature, and N is the number of magnetic moments per unit volume.

By knowing the Curie constant and the Curie temperature of a material, it is possible to calculate the effective magnetic moment of the material.

as a function of temperature, which is the conventional way of presenting susceptibility data for a spin crossover complexes

μeff(T)=(8χ0)^(1/2) 


Using all these informations and compilating this into a general equation:

μeff = (sum (íons moments)^2)^(1/2)

Can be expressed as:

μeff = (ionA^2+ionB^2)^(1/2)

example:

μeff = (Co2+^2+Co3+^2)^(1/2)
